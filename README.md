I'm a Computer Engineering student at Mississippi State University. I was born in Brazil and moved
to the US when I was a child. I can speak fluently in both Portuguese and English, and visit Brazil
occasionally to see my family. My hobbies include gaming, and playing Dungeons and Dragons with 
my friends.
